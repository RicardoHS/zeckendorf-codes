# zeckendorf-codes
Generate generalized Zeckendorf codes (including Fibonacci and Lucas) and use it for file compression.

### Abstract
Compression  systems  today  use  improved  techniques  over  the  years.   Because  of
this,  the  study  and  research  of  certain  more  classical  techniques  has  been  relegated
to the background.  The Fibonacci succession completeness property allows to build a
universal  compressor  code  of  variable  length  based  on  these  numbers.   A  Zeckendorf
Theorem  ensures  the  completeness  of  the  generalized  Fibonacci  number  sequences,
so  these  sequences  would  also  give  rise  to  compressor  codes.
In  this  work  we
build, implement and evaluate compression algorithms based on Fibonacci, Lucas and
generalized  Fibonacci  successions  (which  we  have  called  Zeckendorf  codes).   These
algorithms  have  been  applied  to  the  compression  of  plain  text,  as  they  seem  more
adapted to them.
